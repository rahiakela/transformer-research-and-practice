When my other pills ended, I started Lybrel immediately, on my first day of period, as the instructions said. And the period lasted for two weeks. When taking the second pack- same two weeks. And now, with third pack things got even worse- my third period lasted for two weeks and now it\\'s the end of the third week- I still have daily brown discharge.\\r\\nThe positive side is that I didn\\'t have any other side effects.
